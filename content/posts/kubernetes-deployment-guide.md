Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration. In this guide, we'll explore how to deploy applications effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- kubectl installed
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster
- Basic understanding of containers
- Docker installed locally

## Creating a Deployment

Here's a basic deployment configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

## Exposing Your Service

To make your application accessible, create a service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: my-app
```

## Best Practices

1. Use resource limits and requests
2. Implement health checks
3. Use ConfigMaps and Secrets
4. Enable autoscaling when needed
5. Monitor your deployments

With these fundamentals, you're ready to deploy applications to Kubernetes!
