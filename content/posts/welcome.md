## A New Beginning

Hello! I've finally started my tech blog. This blog was created using the Hugo static site generator.

## Why Hugo?

Here are the reasons I chose Hugo:

1. **Fast Build Speed**: Written in Go, it's incredibly fast
2. **Simple Structure**: Easy to learn and maintain
3. **Powerful Features**: Provides all the features you need
4. **GitHub Pages Support**: Free hosting available

## Blog Features

This blog provides the following features:

### Core Features

- ✅ Markdown-based posting
- ✅ Real-time search
- ✅ Tag system
- ✅ Comments (giscus)
- ✅ RSS feed
- ✅ Dark mode

### Code Highlighting

Code blocks are beautifully displayed:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()
```

```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};

greet("World");
```

### Quotes

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do."  
> — Steve Jobs

## Future Plans

In this blog, I plan to cover the following topics:

- Web development technologies
- Programming language learning
- Open source project experiences
- Development tools and tips

## Closing

I'll continue to bring you quality content. Thank you! 🙏
