Hello! Welcome to my tech blog.

<img src="https://github.com/unsafe9.png" alt="Profile" width="120" style="border-radius: 50%;">

## About Me

I'm a backend engineer working in the gaming industry. My expertise spans across building high-performance backend services, primarily using Go, though I'm not stuck to any specific language. I believe in using whatever tools and technologies are best suited to implement the goals at hand.

My work focuses on several key areas. I design and implement APIs, whether they're REST APIs or gRPC services, ensuring they're robust and well-structured. Database schema design is another critical part of my work, where I model data across both relational databases and NoSQL systems depending on the use case.

I specialize in microservices architecture, designing scalable distributed systems that can handle the demands of modern gaming platforms. Cloud infrastructure and Infrastructure as Code are also parts of my skills, managing cloud resources and automating infrastructure provisioning to maintain reliable and efficient deployments.

## Current Focus

Recently, my interests have shifted toward productivity and automation. I've been exploring productivity enhancement tools and diving deep into AI agents. The field of multi-agent application building particularly fascinates me, as it represents a new frontier in how we can automate complex workflows and build intelligent systems. Developer workflow optimization has become a personal mission, as I believe small improvements in our daily tools can compound into significant productivity gains.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something useful here!
