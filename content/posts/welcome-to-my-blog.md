Hello! I'm a backend engineer sharing insights about building scalable systems, cloud infrastructure, and AI-powered tools.

<img src="https://github.com/unsafe9.png" alt="Profile" width="120" style="border-radius: 50%;">

## What I Do

I build high-performance backend services in the gaming industry, primarily using Go. My focus areas include:

**APIs & Services**
- REST and gRPC service design
- Microservices architecture
- Distributed systems at scale

**Data & Infrastructure**
- Database schema design (SQL and NoSQL)
- Cloud infrastructure management
- Infrastructure as Code

I'm language-agnostic and believe in choosing the right tool for each problem.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog covers:

**AI & Automation**
- AI agents and multi-agent systems
- Developer productivity tools
- Workflow automation

**Backend Engineering**
- System design patterns
- Performance optimization
- Real-world implementation insights

I'm currently exploring how AI agents can transform developer workflows and build more intelligent automation systems.

Thanks for visiting!
