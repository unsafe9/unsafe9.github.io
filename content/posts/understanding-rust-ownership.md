Rust's ownership system is its most unique feature. This post will use the default image since no image is specified.

## What is Ownership?

Ownership is a set of rules that govern how Rust manages memory. Unlike garbage-collected languages, Rust uses a compile-time memory management system.

## The Three Rules

1. Each value has a variable called its owner
2. There can only be one owner at a time
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped

## Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // s1 is moved to s2
    // println!("{}", s1); // This would error!
    println!("{}", s2); // This works
}
```

Understanding ownership is crucial to writing effective Rust code.
